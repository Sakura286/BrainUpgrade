Good morning, professors. I am really glad to be here for this interview. Now, please allow me to give a brief self-introduction.

My name is Chen Xuan, 22 years old. I was born in WeiFang, Shandong. I graduated from Donghua University and majoring in media.        Through studying Professional knowledge and reading books involving relevant specialty, I find myself gradually obsessed with the charm of this major and would like to make some contributions in this field.      At the same time, I realize that until now what I have learned is far from enough for this target, so I take it necessary to continue my learning in this field, that is, I choose to go further with my study to achieve a master’s degree.   （基本信息：姓名、年龄、家乡、 本科学校、专业，说到专业后，进一步介绍想要读研的原因：对专业感兴趣，渴望深造学习）During the four years in this beautiful college, I have been studying very hard and was granted scholarship several times such as National Encouragement scholarship and Mathematics curriculum Award.
